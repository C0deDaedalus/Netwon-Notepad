6. Theme Picker at the bottom right.
7. Much interseting things on the way.

## What NOT It is
It's **`not an iplementation of a text-editor in browser`**. Though you can create a fully functional Browser based Text-Editor. So, You cannot open files, or print , save , export , or cut , copy , paste , or formatting bold , or underline, italics.

*' The Only thing you can do is just write.'* 
Maybe you can use it as a Clipboard or Note taking for a while in browser.

### Have fun with it.
