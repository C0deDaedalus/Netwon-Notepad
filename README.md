# Netwon Notepad UI
A **`minimal User Interface`** for **Browser Based Text Editor** . 

## What NOT It is
It's **`not an iplementation of a text-editor in browser`**. Though you can create a fully functional Browser based Text-Editor. So, You cannot open files, or print , save , export , or cut , copy , paste , or formatting bold , or underline, italics.

*' The Only thing you can do is just write.'* 
Maybe you can use it as a Clipboard or Note taking for a while in browser.

## What it is
It is just an interface for a Browser Based text editor. It's not yet complete & Will be adding more details time to time.
It's a kind of design template featuring Simple Text Editor with :

1. Blue-Black Theme
2. Simple Titlebar & Dropdown Menubar

3. Heart Icon (at beginning of MenuBar) as New Tab Shortcut.
4. Vertically Resizable Textarea
